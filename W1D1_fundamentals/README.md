# What is ES6?

ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. But what exactly is ECMAScript? Initially, it was an abbreviation for the European Computer Manufacturers Association. However, recognizing the organization's global influence, they modified the name to "Ecma."

Ecma is a nonprofit standards organization committed to ensuring the compatibility of client-side scripting languages across diverse browsers. JavaScript, a language aligning with Ecma's standards, is subject to these guidelines. ES6 specifically denotes the 6th edition of these standards, introduced in 2015.

Although there are newer editions of ECMAScript, ES6 isn't the latest. Nevertheless, it represents a significant revision, introducing numerous new features to JavaScript. Consequently, JavaScript developers distinguish between the periods of pre-ES6 and post-ES6 to highlight these transformative changes.

**Here's a list of every feature of ES6 we'll cover today:**

1. The `let` and `const` keywords
2. Destructuring
3. The spread/rest operator
4. Arrow functions
5. The ternary operator
